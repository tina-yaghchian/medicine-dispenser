# Test Plan – Automated Medicine Dispenser

## Tests
1. Communication Range (UART ≥ 1 m) – Pass/Fail
2. Dispensing Ability (each of 5 compartments dispenses) – Pass/Fail
3. Accuracy (±1 pill max) – Pass/Fail/Deviation Notes
4. Pill Size Variability (1–22 mm) – Observations per size
5. Time to Dispense (Total < 10 min) – Measured time

## Results Table (example)
| Run | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Total Time (mm:ss) | Notes |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|---------------------|-------|
| 1   |    |    |    |    |    |                     |       |
| 2   |    |    |    |    |    |                     |       |

## Notes
- Environment: temperature, humidity, distance, power supply
- Firmware version and UART baud rate
